- When building CMakeLists.txt for freeRTOS, I get an error including "sdkconfig.h". That file is generated by idf build process from the Kconfig file. It seems like there are a number of Kconfig files in the esp libraries. So it is worthwhile to pause (figuring out how to build freeRTOS to include in library) and figure out how to generate the "sdkconfig.h" from Kconfig file.
